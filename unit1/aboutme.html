	<h1> About Me</h1>
		<p> I'm a Health Coach and Bartender, living in Seattle Washington. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I wanted to develop my own website for my business and know the behind the scenes of web design so I could build and change it myself instead of paying someone else. </p>

	<h3> My Mission</h3>
		<p> As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Certified Holistic Wellness Coach and work with women who are feeling the need to change and grow into their true and best version of themselves,  because I like to work in a transformational, authentic and progressive environment. </p>

	<h3> My Experience</h3>

		<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>
			<br>

	<ul><li> <strong> Yoga Teacher, </strong> Pacific Yoga Teacher Trainingâ€¨<em> Seattle, 2008-2009</em> </li> </ul>
		
	<ul><li> <strong> Bartender,</strong> Atlantic Crossing Pub
	<em> Seattle, 2007-Presently </em> </li></ul>

<br>

<h3> Other: </h3>

<p> <strong> I am looking to develop a beautiful, and intuitive interactive website that my clients can use almost as a game, with flawless calendar scheduling, goal reaching and tracking progress.   I might need to learn how to develop apps for android and iPhone as well, I want the website to be accessible to clients through their  phones and all devices. </strong></p>
