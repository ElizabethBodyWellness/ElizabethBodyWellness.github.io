	<h2> Find and compare space, size and balance of two different websites.  How could they change for the better? </h2>

		<p> <a href="http://MRMARCELSCHOOL.COM"> Mr. Marcel School </a> 
			<br>
<br>
SPACE:
<br>
Within the slideshow photos that have text, there's adequate use of negative space, but the whole site seems really crowded
It is nice in the rows and columns below, how they the brief titles with lots of negative space around each.  (Patchwork look - different background tones)
<br>
<br>
SIZE:
<br>
Heirarchy is inconsistent.
Some links seem important, but then the next thing is bigger.
<br>
<br>
BALANCE:
<br>
In the 2-column section, with larger rectangles, pictures on one side and link/information on 
Is a nice balance.  When the cursor is on the section, the color brightens up. 
(Gray-scale turns full-color on mouse-over)
(Text inversion from
Everything is evenly balanced within each element (cell).
Everything is centered, Spacing is consistent between lines and within the cell/grid element. 
It's a grid with zero negative space, everything is butt to butt to butt.
<br>
<br>
REEXAMINATION:
	<br>
the slide show on <a href="http://MRMARCELSCHOOL.COM"> Mr. Marcel School </a> is distracting because it moves too fast and you investigate but wish it would stop so you could pay attention to it.
It makes me want to move down.
Even when I move down, I am able to see two automated slide shows at the same time. Not good. </p>

	<br>
SPACE:
<br>
This is a long vertical grid 
Landing Page:
The negative space is 1/3 of the whole section and carries the eye to the main message and logo.
Photos:
The vertical grid has full-width elements with negative space above and below highlights the photos setting them apart.
Interactivity:
As user scrolls down, Focal Point changes, but it's not distracting because the previous element has scrolled off the top of the screen. 
<br>
<br>
SIZE:
<br>
Test size in ABOUT page carries the user through from the MIssion Statement to the short pithy quotes and then into the added reading. And to the photo of the designer.
I like the newsprint style, with faded grey-scale image behind the quotes.
The photo of the designer is a good size and surrounded with negative space.
There is an active arrow that points up to the designer and then down to his work.
<br>
<br>
BALANCE:
<br>
Mix balance style.  Through the different pages, one will have quadrants of balance.
The photos (showing branding) are evenly spaced (with negative space framing) surrounding each.  It feels Very Balanced whether the page is in thirds, halves or quadrants. <br>
<br>
FLOW: <br>
The running arrow is an excellent way to draw the eye through the main points of the whole page.
<br>
<br>
REEXAMINATION: 
<br>
<a href="http://caavadesign.com/"> Caava Design </a> This is a real clean balance, even the boring newspaper page has its own little slide show.
The arrow and waves move across the screen and it's delightful, I just don't know that it could be possible to replicate that.
<br>
He displays his work twice.  He might want to make the logo examples fit on one screen. (But because he has done so much great work, it's good to see many of them at once.)
His artwork section is easy to miss. It's not as focused.
On reload the background photo on the landing page changes. Very cool. 
<br>
When you expand the examples of Work, it adds to the length of the running website, but there's no way to pop it back down - but you're still on the main web page (same address in the navigation bar).

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
	<p> Thumbnails <img width=1000 src="https://462de8315d4c5cedec6cec46b5da88ecc35d55ed.googledrive.com/host/0BxKWeeEJ9TyQams3Q2thYzVsZTg/thumbnailSketches1.jpg"> </img>

		<p> I used the idea of single page app, that rolls through multiple screens as my website thumbnail sketches.  that's why I have it in one long row divided into about 4 screens.  My Index page has a strong circular logo and photo element to set focal point and hirearchy before the viewer would scroll down.  Throughout the rolling page, the eye is drawn to different types of grids, sometimes zero grid, just one large element filling the space, then breaking into a two grid section with text and and picture element, later moving onto a 3 grid page with text and more pictures. My idea is to have a Logo page with catchy mission statement within a picture element, then a solid photo visual with maybe a slideshow, then moving on down to the text of about me section with details about the program.  Then next page section is soloutions for the problem that the client is looking to solve.  and then the 4th section would be the signing up for consolultation and a thank you bar across the bottom.</p>

		<p> I used almost the exact same formula for the flow I wanted through the pages on this second set of thumnails.  Except different placement and shapes but following the same hirearchy and flow with the main element focal point taking up 2/3 of the space on the Index page, then moving down to a photo element, aoout me and program, solution for the problem, and then the sign up form.   again finishing off with a smaller version of the logo and a thank you bar </p>
